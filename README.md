1. Installation:
 You shouldn't need any libraries beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python to execute the code provided. The compatible code should function smoothly with Python versions 3.*.


2. Project Motivation For this project: 
I was interested in using Stack Overflow data from 2017 to understand better:
How did other developers suggest breaking into the field (what education to pursue)? What factors about an individual contribute to salary? How did bias play a role in developers' suggestions for how to break into the field? What was the state of boot camps for assisting individuals with breaking into developer roles? How were boot camps helping with increasing diversity in tech careers? Udacity owns this course's complete set of files, so they are not publicly available here. However, you can see pieces of the analysis here. This README also serves as a template for students to follow in creating their project README files.


3. File Descriptions
 A jupyter notebook is presented here that highlights work related to the questions above based on the RBNB DATA set. The notebook analyses the data across the queries illustrated. Markdown cells have been incorporated to guide the lecturers through the rationale behind each stage. The given code facilitates deriving the ultimate model utilized to forecast salary.


4. How to Interact with our project
The main findings of the code can be found in the post available here.


5. Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements
Acknowledgment is extended to Stack Overflow for supplying the dataset. For details on licensing and further information about the data, please refer to the Kaggle link given. Moreover, feel free to employ the code shared here per your requirements!
