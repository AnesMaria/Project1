 You shouldn't need any libraries beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python to execute the provided  code. 

      2. Project Motivation For this project: 
I was interested in using Airbnb dataset to understand the diffrents variables to apply the theorical and paracticals learned concepts.
    - Market Trends: Investors or potential hosts might be interested in how the market is growing, where the most popular locations are, and which are emerging as 
     new hotspots.
    - Guest Preferences: By looking at ratings, reviews, and amenities of the most booked places, hosts can understand what guests prioritize and then make 
     improvements accordingly.
    - Sentiment Analysis: By analyzing reviews, one can gauge the overall sentiment of guests, understand pain points, and identify areas of improvement.
